// Variables in Go
// A variable is a name for amemory location where a value of a specific type is stored
// in Go, a variable belongs and it is created at runtime
//A declared variable must be used or we get an error!
// _ is the blank identifier and mutes the compile-time error returned by unused variables

// Declaring Variables:
//1. Using the var keyword
var x int = 7
var s1 string
s1 = "Learning Go!"

// 2. Using the short declaration operator (:=)
 age := 30
